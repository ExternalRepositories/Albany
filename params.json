The master branch contains the stable version of Albany that is \r\nbased on Epetra distributed solver data structures.\r\n\r\nThe *tpetra* branch is under development to replace the Epetra architecture with\r\nthe Tpetra and Thyra Trilinos packages. With Tpetra, the ordinal size of the\r\ndistributed data structures is a template parameter which is chosen to match the\r\nfundamental word size of the target computing platform. This enables the calculation of\r\nvery large problems (those over 2.1 billion degrees of freedom). Additionally, Tpetra internally\r\nuses the Kokkos multicore package to support generic multithreaded multicore computing across\r\na wide variety of platforms.\r\n\r\n### Software architecture\r\n\r\nAlbany heavily leverages the Trilinos Framework, available at:\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/repositories/publicTrilinos\r\n\r\nand optionally depends on the SCOREC Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure \r\n[http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/pumi](http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/pumi)\r\n\r\n## Building Albany\r\n\r\nDetailed build instructions for both Trilinos and Albany are maintained at \r\n[http://redmine.scorec.rpi.edu/projects/albany-rpi/wiki](http://redmine.scorec.rpi.edu/projects/albany-rpi/wiki)\r\n\r\n## Nightly Build and Test Results\r\n\r\nThs nightly build results for the Trilinos and SCOREC libraries and the *master* and *tpetra* branches\r\nof Albany are posted on the Albany CDash site. Further, the results of the regression test suite of both\r\nbranches (gathered on a SMP server) are presented on the CDash site at \r\n[http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Albany](http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Albany)\r\n\r\nThe regression test suite is contained within the Albany repository in the directory:\r\n\r\n\t/examples\r\n\r\nThese tests are stand-alone and also serve as nice examples about how to describe various multiphysics problems.\r\nThey also serve as a template for developing new simulations.\r\n\r\nOnce Albany is built, the default test suite is executed by typing *ctest*\r\nwithin the build directory. Any individual test/example can be executed by\r\nchanging directories to the desired example, and executing *ctest* in the\r\nexample directory. The vast majority of Albany tests run in parallel using MPI.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThe HTML user guide is maintained inside the Albany repository at:\r\n\r\n\t/doc/user-guide/guide.html\r\n\r\nThe LaTeX Developer's Guide is located at:\r\n\r\n\t/doc/developersGuide\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
