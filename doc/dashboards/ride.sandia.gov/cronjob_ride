#This is the cronjob that runs nightly on ride to clone and build, 
#Trilinos and Albany, and run Albany tests.  Currently I cannot 
#get the test results to upload from ride to the CDash site.  
#To get arround this, I copy the results to my workstation,
#camobap.ca.sandia.gov, and upload the results to CDash from there.
#See cronjob_camobap for the cronjob on that machine.
