The following are broken in the temporary branch following the merge of master -> tpetra: 

1.) nodalGraph doesn't have adj and start methods implemented, which were introduced into the master branch 
for MeshGraph struct object.  Need to fix.  Please search for IK_FIXME! in Albany_STKDiscretization.cpp .

2.) ExtrudedMeshStruct doesn't get compiled now in the Tpetra branch.  It got rewritten recently in the tpetra
branch and I decided it's easier to re-convert the new function to Tpetra rather than merging.

3.) I have removed saveFieldBlock, saveFieldVector, saveNodal*, registerNodal*, etc. classes, as these are gone from the master branch.These were used in the new evaluator ProjectIPtoNodalField.  That evaluator has been commented out for now.  Needs to be converted
to not rely on missing classes.

4.) mpas_interface code has Epetra.  Needs to be converted.  It's off right now in my build / tests.

5.) Need to check that ALBANY_EPETRA_EXE OFF builds (probably it won't right now), and that the resulting library doesn't have Epetra.

6.) Need to merge Andrew Bradley's recent bug fixes into the temporary branch.

7.) Albany::SolverFactory create* methods have new boolean input "bool createAlbanyApp".  Need to propagate this into Tpetra versions
of these functions.

8.) Adapt_NodalDataBlock saveTepetraNodalDataVector function doesn't work right now -- see IK_FIXME.  There's a problem w/ 
calling saveField on Tpetra_Vector instead of Tpetra_BlockMultiVector inputs.

9.) I am concerned about all the BlockMaps in Albany_STKFieldContainer.  Last time I checked the details Tpetra's BlockMap 
didn't work the same way as Epetra (it had no true concept of block map).  You can only get blockmap from Tpetra_BlockMultiVector (not Tpetra_Vector), hence the code input structure causing the problem 8.).  Something needs to be done about the 

 //if(blocksize < 0)
      //  blocksize = overlap_node_map.ElementSize();

lines in saveField, which are commented out now.
