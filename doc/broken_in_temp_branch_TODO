The following are broken in the temporary branch following the merge of master -> tpetra: 

4.) Have Mauro test mpas_interface.  Resolve issues stemming from long long casting as ints.  --> Irina & Mauro 

10.) ATO suite needs to be converted to Tpetra. Irina has put in for now a an error in CMakeLists.txt if ATO is requested
as it will not build in the Tpetra branch (even with Albany executable).  The code needs to be converted to use the Tpetra 
objects.  To do this, 8.) and 9.) need to be resolved, as ATO makes heavy use of BlockMap --> Andrew B.

12.) Get Albany_FMDBExodus.cpp working. Right now it fails to write an exo file. Comments in that file indicate the issue. All tests produce vtk, rather than exo, files, so this issue is not covered by tests --> Andrew B.

13.) See if ASCR compiles (note that this requires SG_MP to be turned on) in temporary_tpetra_newSTK branch.  
Check if tests pass.  Not necessary to fix these yet, need to just let Eric Phipps know the status (10/23/14) --> Andrew B.

14.) Have Erik Nielsen/Rick Muller (QCAD guys) check ALBANY_CI with temporary_tpetra_newSTK branch of Albany.  Also 
have them run some "real" QCAD tests to check that everything still works (right now with Albany executable only). --> Irina, Erik, Rick.

15.) Fix up cism_interface, the compilation of which got broken in temporary_tpetra_newSTK branch (10/23/14) --> Irina K. 

Failed tests (10/24/14): 
The following tests FAILED:
	 51 - SteadyHeat2DInternalNeumann (Failed) - STK bug (Jim Foucar fixing; fails in branch master too)
	 52 - SteadyHeat2DInternalNeumann_Tpetra (Failed) - STK bug (Jim Foucar fixing)
