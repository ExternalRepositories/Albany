This file summarizes what is missing in Trilinos / Albany as of Aug. 2014, which 
prevents running the AlbanyT executable in the Albany Tpetra branch.


Piro: 
- Need to add Piro_Thyra_RythmosSolver* to piro package of Trilinos.  
Without this, it is not possible to select specialized time integration schemes
with the AlbanyT executable.  Albany problems affected: Aeras, ComprNS, LinComprNS, 
NSRayleighBernard2D, NSVortexShedding2D.
- Need to add Piro_Thyra_InvertMassMatrixDecorator* to piro package of Trilinos.
- Need to add Piro_Thyra_VelocityVerletSolver* to piro package of Trilinos.
This requires extending the Thyra model evaluator to work with xdotdot.
Albany problems affected: 
- Need to add Piro_Thyra_TrapezoidRuleSolver* to piro package of Trilinos.
Albany problems affected: LCM/Dynamics 


Ifpack2: 
- It appears ILU is not available in Ifpack2, just ILUT.


MueLu:
- For repartitioning, the coordinates need to be passed from Albany -> MueLu.  To do this, 
a piro class called Piro_MueLuNullSpace utils needs to be written.  The following are examples that require
repartitioning using coordinates so they will not work properly with MueLu: 
LCM/ThermoElasticity3D/input.xml 
LCM/MechanicsTensileTet10/NotchedTensileTet10.xml 
- The following tests that use MueLu have a seg fault.  Need to figure out what is the problem:
FELIX/FO_Test/input_fo_confinedShelf.xml (seg fault in parallel only)
FELIX/FO_Test/input_fo_confinedShelf_depthIntBC.xml (seg fault in parallel only)
QCAD/Poisson/input_mosdot_3D_tet10.xml
- The following examples required "aggregation: local aggregates" and "aggregation: nodes per aggregate" 
to be implemented in the METIS/ParMETIS interface:
LCM/MechanicsWithTemperature/ThermalExpansion.xml
LCM/MechanicsWithTemperature/MechanicsWithTemperature.xml


Amesos2: 
- Amesos2 is not at all hooked up to Stratimikos.  Need to do this.  
Albany problems affected: LCM/ThermoPoroMechanics3D, LCM/TLPoroElasticity2D, 
LCM/TLPoroElasticity3D, LCM/UnSatPoroElasticity3D, LCM/MechanicsPorePressure/inputOrthogonalFlow.xml


Comments:
- "NOX" can be called in parameter list under "Piro" instead of "ThyraNOX" when 
running with the AlbanyT executable (e.g., SteadyHeat2D/inputThyra.xml, TransientHeat2D/inputThyra.xml). 
- All examples in Albany tpetra branch have been converted to use Belos instead of AztecOO. 
The latter will not work with the AlbanyT executable if requesting more than 1 
sensitivity (epetraToThyra and MV dimension != 1 error).  


TO DOs (Irina K., Andy, et al.): 
- Figure out AlbanyAnalysisT executable error.  Test AlbanyAnalysisT executable when code has been built with DAKOTA (Andy).
- Look into sensitivity / response discrepancies in FELIX/FO_Test and LCM/Mechanics2D 
- Convert / test exodiff/python tests.
- Figure out time growing unbounded issue in LCM/Catalyst, LCM/Elasticity3DPressureBC, LCM/LaplaceBeltrami/2DCylMotion
- Sit down with QCAD developers (Rick, Erik) to figure out what's missing in QCAD suite.
- Figure out NaNs in LCM/MechanicsPorePressure/inputMechanics.xml (email Jake?)  
- Figure out why "Piro Defaults Filename" is not recognized by AlbanyT executable for QCAD/Schrodinger/*qcad.xml problems
- Anasazi seg fault when running inputT.xml for NSVortexShedding2D problem. 
- Sensitivities are different when running with Belos comapred to AztecOO for FELIX_Stokes/FO_Test/*interpSurf.xml (with Albany executable)!
- Different responses when running with Belos than AztecOO for: LinComprNS/input2D_drivenPulse.xml, LinComprNS/input3Dunsteady.xml, 
LinComprNS/input3DunsteadyNS.xml...
