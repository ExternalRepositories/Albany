This is a test for single slip. It is still evolving.

We will revise the *Explcit* test soon. Right now it is still uniaxial stress.

The *Implicit* test is now uniaxial strain and compares will with a numerical solution from Mathematica.

Mathematica files:

singleSlip.nb - numerical solution to single slip
singleSlip.pdf - pdf of Mathematica solution
slipsTausMath.dat - dump of the slip vs. the shear stress (intermediate configuration)
fpCauchy11Math.dat - dump of Fp(1,1) vs. Cauchy_Stres(1,1) 

Python scripts:

postSingleSlipPlan.py - dumps slip, shear stress, Fp, and Cauchy stress for comparison.

- the python script should probably compare quantities. Right now the norms are compared in Mathematica.

More work to come....

NOTE: We still need to resolve a few significant figures in the Cauchy stress.
