*** WARNING ***

Some functionalities that were present in Albany in the past
are no longer supported, and have been removed. Usually, this happened
because of lack of resources to maintain the feature, and/or to upgrade
the code to be compliant with newer Albany and/or Trilinos infrastructure.

For each of these functionalities, we added a git tag to the repo,
corresponding to the last commit supporting the functionality.
To revive a feature 'BLAH', you can checkout the last version of the
code supporting the feature with

git checkout tags/BLAH_support_end

You can also find information on the trilinos revision to use in the tag
comment; simply do

git tag -v BLAH_support_end


Most of these functionalities correspond to a particular folder
in Albany. Such folder is still present, empty, but with a README file
inside, with the instruction on how to checkout the tag.

Additionally, there's the tag PERIDIGM_support_end, which corresponds
to the last commit supporting Peridigm features.
