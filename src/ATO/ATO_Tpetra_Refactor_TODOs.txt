This file lists the work that is still needed to finish 
refactoring ATO to work with Tpetra/Thyra instead of 
Epetra/EpetraExt, in no particular order (dependencies 
b/w action items are noted).  

1. Debug Tpetra function ReplaceDiagonalValues,
currently in Albany::Utils (should ultimately be moved to the 
Tpetra::CrsMatrix class). This function is used in the 
ATOT::XFEM_Preconditioner.cpp class. 

2. Have Mark Hoemmen fix Tpetra::CrsMatrix::apply method with a 
TRANS combine mode.  Once this is done, remove creation of 
filterOperatorTpetra in ATO::Solver and ATOT::Solver, and
uncomment relevant apply code in copyObjectiveFromStateMgr 
routines.

3. Switch distributed parameters in Albany to use Tpetra instead 
of Epetra.  This requires replacing workset.overlapped_dgdp and 
workset.dgdp with Tpetra versions and changing calls in 
ATO::TensorPNormResponse and ATO::HomogenizedConstantsResponse 
to use these new objects.

4. Test/debug new ATOT::Solver by running tests with AlbanyT 
executable.

5. Once 4. is done, create tests that run with AlbanyT executable.
