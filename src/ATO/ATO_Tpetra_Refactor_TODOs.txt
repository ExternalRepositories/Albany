This file lists the work that is still needed to finish 
refactoring ATO to work with Tpetra/Thyra instead of 
Epetra/EpetraExt, in no particular order (dependencies 
b/w action items are noted).  

1. Debug Tpetra function ReplaceDiagonalValues,
currently in Albany::Utils (should ultimately be moved to the 
Tpetra::CrsMatrix class). This function is used in the 
ATOT::XFEM_Preconditioner.cpp class. 

2. Have Mark Hoemmen fix Tpetra::CrsMatrix::apply method with a 
TRANS combine mode.  Once this is done, remove creation of 
filterOperatorTpetra in ATO::Solver and ATOT::Solver, and
uncomment relevant apply code in copyObjectiveFromStateMgr 
routines.

3. Switch distributed parameters in Albany to use Tpetra instead 
of Epetra.  This requires replacing workset.overlapped_dgdp and 
workset.dgdp with Tpetra versions and changing calls in 
ATO::TensorPNormResponse and ATO::HomogenizedConstantsResponse 
to use these new objects.

4. Test/debug new ATOT::Solver by running tests with AlbanyT 
executable.  Currently, the following tests seg fault when run:

- RegHeaviside_3D: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (**) 
- DistParam_2D: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (*) 
- Mitchell_3D: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (**) 
- Thermal_MultiMech_3D: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (**)  
- Constraint_2D: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (*) 
- FixedBlocks: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (**)
- Restart: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (**)
- 2Matl_Homog:  

(*) error in debug: 
p=0: *** Caught standard std::exception of type 'Teuchos::NullReferenceError' :
 /home/ikalash/LCM/Trilinos/packages/teuchos/core/src/Teuchos_RCPNode.cpp:741:

(**) error in debug:

 Throw number = 1
 Throw test that evaluated to true: !( 0 <= i && i < size() )
 Array<T>::assertIndex(i): i=1 out of range [0, 1)


The other tests run, but give different solution than their Epetra versions,
which needs to be debugged.  Note that NLOpt was not on in my build; need to build
with NLOpt and test NLOpt tests as well.  

5. Once 4. is done, create tests that run with AlbanyT executable.  

6. For Tpetra input files for 2Matl_Homog, Cogent_Opt and Cogent_ThermoMech
that use MueLu with same settings as ML.  These test originally had ML, 
but I have switched them to Ifpack2, due to complexity of MueLu settings.
