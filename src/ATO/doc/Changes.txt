LB 4/24/19:

- The ATOT-ATO classes duplication has been eliminated: ATOT classes
  have been removed, and ATO classes have been made to use Thyra
  structures now. In no place in the ATO folder we now assume anything
  about the underlying linear algebra. The only thing we assume (sometimes)
  is that vector spaces are SpmdVectorSpace's.
- XFEM classes have been removed, since they were not used, nor
  tested. To revive them, check out 3600566
