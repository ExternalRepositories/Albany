    Albany is the main demonstration application of the AgileComponents software development
    strategy at Sandia. It is a PDE code that strives to be built almost entirely
    from functionality contained within reusable libraries (such as Trilinos/STK/Dakota/PUMI).
    Albany plays a large role in demonstrating and maturing functionality
    of new libraries, and also in the interfaces and interoperability
    between these libraries. It also serves to expose gaps in our
    coverage of capabilities and interface design.
    
    <br>
    
    Another aspect of the project is to serve as a template for
    writing new applications against Trilinos/STK/Dakota/PUMI. It
    uses CMake, CTest, and git, and grabs almost all configuration
    information from the underlying Trilinos installation, to simplify
    the build process.
    
    <h3> Distinguishing Capabilities </h3>
  
    The highlight of Albany is the PDE assembly. The template-based
    generic programming approach allows developers to just program
    for residual equations, and all manner of derivatives and polynomial
    propagations get automatically computed with no development effort.
    This approach uses Phalanx for rapid and flexible addition of 
    physics, which works closely
    with Sacado and Stokhos for automatic propagation of
    derivatives and UQ. The Trilinos Intrepid and Shards packages are used for
    the local discretization. 
    
    <br>
    
    A second strength of Albany is the demonstration of
    transformational analysis algorithms.  Albany demonstrates
    the direct use of all Solver/Analysis tools in Trilinos
    (through Piro, which was developed in Albany) including NOX, 
    LOCA, Rythmos, Stokhos,
    and all of Dakota. On any problem we not only get a solution,
    but can also get sensitivities, run optimization problems, and 
    perform uncertainty quantification.  All of these approaches
    can access all of the linear solver options in Trilinos that
    are exposed by the Stratimikos layer.
    
    <br>

    The third main strength
    is the early adoption of STK, the sierra toolkit libraries. 
    This includes the mesh database, IO, and mesh adaptation
    capabilities from stk_rebalance and stk_adapt.
    
    <h3> Physics Sets: what PDEs </h3>
  
    Albany strives for a bit of a paradigm shift, where a code
    is defined more by its analysis capabilities and data structure
    choices, which are difficult to change, and less by the physics set. 
    
    <br>
    
    At inception, much of Albany was developed for solving simple 
    PDEs such as heat transfer 
    and Poisson equations. With nonlinear source terms, this was
    adequate for developing and verifying all the hooks for
    analysis algorithms from sensitivity analysis to UQ.
    Recently, a wide variety of new physics capabilities and coupled
    equation systems have been added to 
    the general Albany physics set. The Albany example set illustrates
    implementations of many of the physical models that Albany currently
    supports, and serves as example implementations, templates suitable for extension,
    and as a regression test suite.
    
    <br>
    
    As Albany developed, several projects were developed on top
    of the base Albany capability set. These include the Laboratory
    for Computational Mechanics, the Quantum Device Design, and the
    Embedded UQ project.
    
    <h3> LCM: Laboratory for Computational Mechanics </h3>
    
    The first application project build on Albany is the LCM,
    or Laboratory for Computational Mechanics 
    [Ostien-PI, Salinger, Mota, Foulk, Littlewood].
    This project is creating an OpenSource computational mechanics 
    RandD code, with a particular emphasis on fracture and failure models. 
    The infrastructure in Albany, which is aimed at rapid development
    of new physics with automated generation of analytic derivatives 
    and sensitivities, is well suited for trying out new discretizations 
    and new material models.  The links to Dakota and handling of model 
    parameter are set up to perform calibration and UQ studies.
    LCM serves as a research tool that can be shared with
    academics. Successful research ideas and code will be
    migrated to the production mechanics applications of Adagio and Presto.
    Albany can link against the LAME material library, and we
    are looking at ways of getting derivative info through it
    for more robust solution algorithms.

    <h3> QCAD: Quantum Device Design </h3>
    
    The other new application code built on Albany is the
    QCAD quantum dot design LDRD (Schrodinger-Poisson) 
    [Muller-PI, Gao, Nielsen, Salinger]. A Poisson solve for
    classical representation of charge distribution is
    coupled to a Schrodinger region for quantum effects.
    
    <h3> Embedded UQ </h3>
    
    Albany is also serving as a main development and
    demonstration environment for embedded UQ research
    [Phipps-PI, Wildey]. By leveraging the templated
    fill environment, polynomial representations can
    be directly propagated through the physics assembly.
    Many issues with data structures, parallelization, 
    and linear algebra are being addressed.
    
    <h3> Further development </h3>
    
    Future development in Albany includes: load balancing and uniform mesh refinement,
    transitioning to Tpetra and a templated software stack, being a testbed
    for embedded UQ methods, early adoption of architecture-aware PDE
    assembly kernels, development of full error estimation and 
    adaptivity capabilities, and the exploration of the scalability of complex
    multiphysics applications on massively parallel computers that employ 
    multicore architectures.
